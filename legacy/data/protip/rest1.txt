?
 if you're sad.
 whenever you're bored.
 if you're feeling lucky.
 just because you can.
 because the universe says so.
 when you're excited.
 if you're losing.
 if you're winning.
 if you want to have fun.
 just to see what would happen.
 if you're mad.
 when someone steals your sweetroll.
 if you want to win.
 if you want to lose.
 if you want to do well.
 if you want to fail.
 if you're failing.
 when you just want to give up.
 if there's nothing left to do.
 to be happy.
 to be sad.
 if you can.
 to become more intelligent.
 because it would be really funny.
 to make someone happy.
 to make the world a better place.
 to avoid being sad.
 to cheer up.
 because it's your only chance.
 because life is too short not to.
 because it would be funny.
 because I told you so.
 because it's good for you.
 if you're happy.
 if you're in a good mood.
 multiple times.
 twice.
 three times.
 four times.
 as much as you want.
 whenever you want.
 and do what you want to it.
 and never tell anyone about it.
 and tell everyone about it.
